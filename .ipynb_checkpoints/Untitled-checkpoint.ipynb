    "I have been working from June to August in a project as part of the Google Summer of Code 2020 (GSoc 2020). The goal of my project was to implement in PyNN and NeuroML(lite) previously published large-scale brain models. The models chosen were a model published by [Joglekar et. al.](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30152-1) for the macaque monkey cortex using rate models, spiking neuronal networks and anatomical data from retrogate tracing and a model for the human brain published by [Demirtas et. al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627319300443) using a model for Bold signals and anatomical data obtained by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). During all the process I had the support of my mentors, Padraig Gleeson and Ankur Sinha, and International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). Here, I am going to give a short explanation about the main tools used, summarize the steps of the project, the challenges that I faced during implementation and the future work that will be done.   \n",

    "[PyNN](https://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/) is a python package for simulation of spiking neuronal network models. Through PyNN it is possible to implement models in a simulator-independent language and run using some simulator backends, for example, [Neuron](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), [BRIAN](https://briansimulator.org/) and [NEST](https://www.nest-initiative.org/?page=Software).\n",

    "The goal in this paper was to show that the balanced amplification beetwen cortical areas enhances signal propagation in a large-scale model for the macaque monkey cortex. First, they showed using a simple rate model, composed of one excitatory and one inhibitory population, that local balanced amplification causes an increase of the firing rate for excitatory population. In addition, it was presented the relation between peak of firing rate in excitatory population and the weights for connections from excitatory to excitatory and from inhibitory to excitatory.\n",

    "They created a large-scale cortical model where the dynamical behavior of each area was described by interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory. For each cortical area the same model for the previous analysis was used. They found that activity propagation in a large-scale cortical model with long range excitatory connections leads to either strong attenuation or instability.\n",

    "They extended the idea to local balanced amplification to large-scale cortical model. In global balanced amplification (GBA) the strong long-range excitation is stabilized by the local inhibition. IT was showed that the global balanced amplification improves signal propagation.\n",

    "The idea of GBA was also implemented to a more detailed model proposed by [Mejias et. al.](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/11/e1601335). The main result of this paper was the propagation of signal (asynchronous and synchronous) between spiking neuronal networks that describes the activity of each cortical area in the large scale cortical model. \n",

    "Fortunately, the original codes in Brian2 and Matlab were avaliable on github. I organized the codes in Brian2 in order to generate different simulations using the same main code. Thus, by parsing different command line arguments it is possible to generate simulations with of different figures, with different number of areas and different signal (synchonous or asynchronous). First challenge was to implement the large-scale model with spiking neuronal networks in PyNN. In the original code the synapses are given by a delta function, it means an action potential in the presynaptic neuron generate an discrete increment in the postsynaptic potential. However, delta-function synapses are not implemented in PyNN. To overcome this situation, I verified what parameters make alpha-function synapses behave like the delta synapses in the model. \n",
